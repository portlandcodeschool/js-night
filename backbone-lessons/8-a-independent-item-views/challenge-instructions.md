### Challenge Instructions

- Make a new app based on this one
- There is no need to persist data (unless you have time when you're done and want to)
- The app should not be a todo app. Give it content of similar complexity
- You can leave the client-side code all in the main.js file or break it out into separate files
- There is no need to use browserify in this example. Use script tags instead.
