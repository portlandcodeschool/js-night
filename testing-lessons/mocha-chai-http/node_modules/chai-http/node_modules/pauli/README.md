Generatea v4 compatible UUID. By default, will return the UUID as a string formatted 
according to `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. 

```js
var pauli = require('pauli')
  , uuid = pauli.uuid();

console.log(uuid);
// '2c3a0561-847f-4cae-8161-c52908cbcf53'
```

#### .uuid.toString(buf)

- *@param* _{Buffer}_ buffer to convert
- *@returns* _String}_ formatted uuid

Should you have generated a buffer, you can then convert it to a string. 

```js
var puali = require('pauli')
  , buf = pauli.uuid(true)
  , uuid = pauli.uuid.toString(buf);

console.log(uuid);
// '2c3a0561-847f-4cae-8161-c52908cbcf53'
```
