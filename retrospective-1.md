1. General Feedback: Come up with one of each (Red, Green, Yellow Light) that you all agree on:
    - Red Light -- What is something in the class you wish would STOP

    -- referencing the same card problem each week is useful to provide context to the variability in programming, and provide some new difficulty each week but the format makes those that are falling behind feel as though the can't catch up without finishing the previous assignments.

    -- Scratchpad can be confusing with the ability to compile portions of the code. Maybe extend the whitespace so that the only code visible is being processed.

    - Green Light
        -- making materials like scratchpad available is good.
        -- Teachers are very approachable and more than willing to help.

    - Yellow Light
         -- record the video for the class so we can review it later.
         -- more baby steps in both homework and class, still go over same material but maybe announce that things are getting to get difficult. Frequently we feel that we just start to understand something and then the instructors will bring up an off example that breaks the code, or defies our logic with the understanding we have already.
         -- flash 3 min of homework solutions each class.

2. How much total study time have you been putting in outside of class(not just homework)?  Average this number of hours for your group. Come to a consensus about whether this is enough time for you to succeed in the course.
    -- 6-7/week hours and no it is not enough

3. What has proved to be the most effective way to get through the homework sucessfully?

    -- go over scratchpad
    -- really go through the book if needed
    -- study groups
    -- start putting down code.
    -- packagecontrol jshint

4. Come to a consensus about whether the homework is too much, too little, or the perfect amount.

    -- a necessary evil
    -- Rather have a crap load of homework than pay more money

1.
Red :   Stop making HW so difficult.
Yellow: Example item in class that needs to match HW
Green:  Diagrams and their relationships to actual code

2) Average # of study of study time - 15 hours a week

3)  15 hours a week of study time is spent catching up reading and tutorials. Not doing HW.

4)  HW is too difficult. Overwhelming.     We had a study group yesterday (4 students and TA Chris) and worked on Week 1 HW question 2

### Hanna, Liam, Nathan, Tom

RED: - more overarching outline for lecture -- not quite so many tangents, perhaps less as long breaks
YELLOW: - look at homework in class, go over it as a group (even just 15 minutes to get the core of what was important in the homework)
GREEN: - like the notes and scratchpads provided, staff availability, examples in class

average time spent on hw/study outside of class: 15 hours (we had a huge range- from 6 hours to 30+ depending). decided we need more time

success tips for homework: starting asap (Thursday), reaching out to staff and other students for help

is homework appropriate? yes, if you have not fallen behind

1.

RED:

    Less distractions to allow for more participation (noise in room makes it hard to concentrate, people get distracted on their laptops and zone out sometimes)


GREEN:

    Diagrams during class are helpful. Also that they are posted for reference.
    Detailed explanation of concepts.
    Repetition- going over problems to enforce what we just learned.


YELLOW:

    Homework review - at least one problem in depth as it can be too time consuming to go over the whole thing. Maybe one that a lot of people seemed to have trouble with.
    Short review of previous lecture at the beginning of class (may not be necessary if we are doing the above)
    Have students take more initiative to meet face to face outside of class to work on homework/study/etc.
    It would be helpful to work on challenges or do group work during Saturday sessions especially. Doesn't have to be long.. But would be a good way to review what we just went over during the first half of lecture.
    Have a hard break on break time. Sometimes Dan starts talking but people are still socializing so it's hard to concentrate :)


2. On average, we spend about eight hours on homework + study time outside of class time.

3. We frequent MDN to help us through homework (reviewing concepts, etc). We also try to avoid Stack Overflow as it seems to sidetrack us more than help sometimes.

4. Homework is manageable to too much. Easy to fall behind with the card problem and feel defeated.

Green light:
Posting scratchpad is awesome!
Pair programming is helpful!

Yellow:
Less required homework, more optional, sorted by level of requirement


Red:
Distractions in space
Less obtuse math-things that are applicable
