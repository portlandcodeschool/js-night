### Josh's group
1.
Red :   Stop making HW so difficult.
Yellow: Example item in class that needs to match HW
Green:  Diagrams and their relationships to actual code

2) Average # of study of study time - 15 hours a week

3)  15 hours a week of study time is spent catching up reading and tutorials. Not doing HW.

4)  HW is too difficult. Overwhelming.     We had a study group yesterday (4 students and TA Chris) and worked on Week 1 HW question 2

### Hanna, Liam, Nathan, Tom

RED: - more overarching outline for lecture -- not quite so many tangents, perhaps less as long breaks
YELLOW: - look at homework in class, go over it as a group (even just 15 minutes to get the core of what was important in the homework)
GREEN: - like the notes and scratchpads provided, staff availability, examples in class

average time spent on hw/study outside of class: 15 hours (we had a huge range- from 6 hours to 30+ depending). decided we need more time

success tips for homework: starting asap (Thursday), reaching out to staff and other students for help

is homework appropriate? yes, if you have not fallen behind


### Esha's Group

1.

RED:

    Less distractions to allow for more participation (noise in room makes it hard to concentrate, people get distracted on their laptops and zone out sometimes)


GREEN:

    Diagrams during class are helpful. Also that they are posted for reference.
    Detailed explanation of concepts.
    Repetition- going over problems to enforce what we just learned.


YELLOW:

    Homework review - at least one problem in depth as it can be too time consuming to go over the whole thing. Maybe one that a lot of people seemed to have trouble with.
    Short review of previous lecture at the beginning of class (may not be necessary if we are doing the above)
    Have students take more initiative to meet face to face outside of class to work on homework/study/etc.
    It would be helpful to work on challenges or do group work during Saturday sessions especially. Doesn't have to be long.. But would be a good way to review what we just went over during the first half of lecture.
    Have a hard break on break time. Sometimes Dan starts talking but people are still socializing so it's hard to concentrate :)


2. On average, we spend about eight hours on homework + study time outside of class time.

3. We frequent MDN to help us through homework (reviewing concepts, etc). We also try to avoid Stack Overflow as it seems to sidetrack us more than help sometimes.

4. Homework is manageable to too much. Easy to fall behind with the card problem and feel defeated.
