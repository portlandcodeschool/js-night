# Collaboritive Git Worflow for Homework

1. Make sure you are in the directory where you want your homework project directory to be stored
2. `git clone 'urlGoesHere'`
3. cd to the project directory
4. `git checkout -b branchWithYourNameOnIt`
5. `mkdir dirWithYourNameOnIt`
6. `touch assignmentName.js` to create the file with your homework in it.
7. Do the exercises below (don't forget to save)
8. `git add assignmentName.js` to add changes
9. `git commit -m "commit message here"`.
10. `git push` (make sure you are still on the branch with your name on it before you push.)
11. Submit a pull request on github
12. Look at feedback from instructors
13. Make changes
14. Repeat steps 8-10. There is no need to get rid of the previous pull request and make a new one since the pull request is still open and unresolved. Just push your new changes. The pull request will automatically update. Make sure you are on the branch with your name on it when you push.
