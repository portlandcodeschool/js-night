-Proposed naming conventions: 'jsn-sum14-1' (javascript night summer 2014 week 1)
-whitney has labeled his repos jsi for immersion, perhaps jsn will help us differentiate. The organizations repo list is getting a little cluttered, so we'll have to figure out how to mitigate that.

    -This part of the weekly assignments should be considered the goal that people are trying to reach in their learning for the week.
###Part 3: Very Challenging
