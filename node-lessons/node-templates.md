*General Questions/ Issues*

### Pre-class-homework: 
- Read Node.js in Action pp. 264-269, 276-280 (chapter/sections 11.1 and 11.3)
- Don't pay too much attention to EJS, it's just an example. We won't be using it in class.

### Post-class-homework: 
- Try examples on the [Hogan.js homepage](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/)
- Since Hogan is Mustache.js compatible, try examples from the [Mustache Docs](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html)
- Integrate some Hogan templates into some previous node examples from class, homework, etc. Even better, make a new node server that renders Hogan templates and serves them up. 
 
### Templating without the templates
- We can accomplish the task of templating with pure js, it just won't be very pretty

### Templating with Hogan.js on the Server
