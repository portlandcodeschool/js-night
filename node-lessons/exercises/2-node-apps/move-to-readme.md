Homework 7

1. Make a new app using the to-do app from class as an example. In other words, create an app of similar complexity but different content. It should have the ability to handle a "GET", "POST", and "DELETE".
2. Try to add at least one feature that does not correspond to any features in the todo app. 
3. Feel free to indulge a little bit in presentation of the ui. This will come in handy as you make a portfolio site and work on your eventual capstone project.
4. Make comments on teammates' pull requests to suggest a feature or to help make the code better. 
5. When you have addressed (not necessarily agreed with) all of the pull requests provided by teammates, you may merge your pull request. Use the git workflow from git slideshow #2. Please do not forget to put your work in a named branch (with your name on it) and in a folder/ directory( you may title the folder whatever you like, so long as it is unique).

Goals: 
- To move beyond tinkering with an in-class problem (the to-do app) and to use it as a blueprint for a similar app.
- To see how modeling a new app after another one immediately leads to changes in the way the app is set up. Usually, this means more complexity and it definitely means plenty of refactoring.

Suggestions:
- Use a browser "REST" client or curl to interact with your app, particularly for POST and DELETE.
- Use JShint to help clean up your code and to help you figure out what might be wrong with it.
- Try to use the interpolator function used in class, but if you can't, just concatenate html strings and javascript values manually. 
- Pre-code. Draw diagrams, pictures. Do napkin scribbles. Write pseudo code. Don't get stuck staring at the blank screen. Write something, even if is not code. 
- When it is time to write code, don't be afraid to write bad code. It is universally true that one must write bad code before good code (otherwise you would never get anything done).
- Talk with your teammates and classmates about feature ideas. Don't feel like you have to brainstorm alone.
