*General Questions/ Issues*

- Lesson plans for node and the student's individual projects will follow complexity increase similar to that of http-framework.
- There will be an example project iteration for every example, in the form of a recipe app
    + Start at hello world http server
    + End at an app that: 
        * has a node.js server that:
            - serves static files
            - serves api data
        * has a thick client, using Backbone js 
            - loads and saves necessary data
            - utilizes templates
            - has multiple pages that are handled by Backbone, not a server round-trip
            - has dynamic content and functionality

1. Node, Node modules, Node FS module, testing
2. Node http server, basic concepts in-depth, internet concepts
    - request and response objects
    - HTTP Headers and bodies
    - basic routes with control flow logic
    - basic resources (plain text, html, or JSON inline)
    - mime type explanation
3. More node http server Routes with no outside modules, static file server
4. Routes with Routes-router (or similar), testing with a testing framework
5. More helper modules (send-data/html, for instance), Streams in node
6. The concept and purpose of templates, templates with Hogan.js
7. Data Persistence: Orchestrate
8. Orchestrate, part 2
9. Basic Username and password authentication
