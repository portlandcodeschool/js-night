*General Questions/ Issues*
- Once we start http servers, content should begin to veer toward making a portfolio site. 
- Lesson plans for node and the student's individual projects will follow complexity increase similar to that of http-framework.
    + Start at hello world http server
    + End at an app that: 
        * has a node.js server that:
            - serves static files
            - serves api data
            - handles basic password auth at least
        * has a thick client, using ember js 
            - loads and saves necessary data
                + postgres or mongo
            - utilizes templates
            - has multiple pages that are handled by ember not a server round-trip
            - has dynamic content and functionality
