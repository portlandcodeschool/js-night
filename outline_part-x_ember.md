*General Questions/ Issues*
- We need a descriptive diagram of all of embers parts and how they relate
    + Codeschool.com has a nice example. I like how they lay theirs out, but ours would need to have more annotations.
- We should be able to use the new ember CLI to give the students the tools to: 
    + Generate new projects
    + Test their ember code
    + Make their projects modular with ES6 modules instead of require.js or another solution


#Main Ember Topics

###Ember Router, Templates, and Ember Starter Kit (1 session)
    - Testing in the Ember Starter Kit with QUnit
        + [ember starter kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit)
        + [ember-cartoon-character viewer](https://github.com/BenjaminVerble/ember-cartoon-character-viewer)
            * A very simple, non-modular demonstration of some of embers features and the ember starter kit
            * QUnit is included in this module as well

###Ember Controller, Routes, and Models (1 session)

###Ember Data

###Reinforce Ember Conventions and explain their purpose

###Putting It All Together: Individual projects (Multiweek)
    * Students will construct an example app over a two week period using express.js, ember.js, and some sort of data persistance
