Lessons: 
1) Be excellent to each other; programming is team sport.

2) Don't be helpless!  Take charge of solving mysteries through whatever path you can.

3) Parentheses always balance!  Can usually determine structure of a phrase even if some elements are unfamiliar.

4) Be cautious about your assumptions.  The computer has a consistent logic, but not always the logic you expect.
