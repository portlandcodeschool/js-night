### Learning Objectives:
- Learn a strategy for beginning to separate code into separate files and modules


### Students Should be Able to:
- Separate js code and templates into separate files without breaking the code

### Assignment
- Refactor app to have each model, controller, and view in a separate file.
- Keep one key part of your app in main.js (this should be the final file to be loaded and executed)
- Note the load order demonstrated in index.html. This app has already been partially refactored to have certain elements in separate files. Follow this pattern.
