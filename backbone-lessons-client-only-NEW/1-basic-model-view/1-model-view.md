### Learning Objectives:

- Get or keep JS dependencies working
- Create a Backbone model class
- Create a Backbone model instance with properties
- Experiment with Backbone models and their properties in the console
    + Console.log properties
    + Access Backbone models directly from the command line (because in these simple examples, practically everything is in a global var)

    + has a render function that inserts the resulting "template" from some html strings and content from their Backbone Models
- Make connections between dom element manipulation with vanilla js dom methods, jQuery, and Backbone
