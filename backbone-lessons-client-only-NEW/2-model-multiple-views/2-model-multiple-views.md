### Learning Objectives:

- Use multiple Backbone views
- Use a Backbone view to capture input values and store their values in a Backbone model
- Set up another view to respond to changes in this model and re-render that view
- Backbone events (in this case, in views)

### Students Should be Able to:
- set up a click event using the events property of a Backbone view
- utilize `event.preventDefault()` to prevent browser form submission when using backbone to capture button click events in form elements
- listen for model changes in Backbone view's initialize method
- Manage more complexity that comes from building something with a JS framework
- Use multiple views according to the example provided
- Use this app as a scaffold to create an app of similar complexity
